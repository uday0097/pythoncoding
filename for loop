for loop iterates over each item in a sequence.
syntax: for each_item in sequence:
           condition             this is for string it is a sequence of characters
program1:word="python"
          for each_char in word:
              print(each_char)     
              output is:p
y
t
h
o
n
if we want sequence of numbers we use range that is range(n) where n is not included
for example:
for number in range(5):
    print(number)
output:0
1
2
4
program: Program to print right angle traingle **
n=int(input())
for triangle in range(n):
    print("* "*(triangle+1))
We can also use like starting and ending range example: for num in range(5,7): here ouput is 5 and 6
