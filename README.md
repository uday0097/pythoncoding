# pythoncoding
Here I will write all the concepts in python and also coding 
Software:Set of instructions given to the hardware
Programming: Writing the instructions to create a software
coding:The instructions that we write to create a software
Syntax:Unique set of rules
Why Python:
It is easy and powerful language with minimal set of codes and also it is a versatile language used in AI ML Big Data  IOT cyber game and backend etc
Devops engineer Software Data scientist, Data Analyst , etc
examples for simple programming are
print("Hello world")
print(2+5)
print("2+5")
Variables:
Variables are like containers to store values i.e information
Values in variable can be changed
Every value or data has an associated type called data type.
Example are:
String
Integer
Float 
Boolean
String is a stream of characters associated with quotes
Integer is all whole numbers +ve and -ve including zero.
Float is any number with decimal points
Boolean is generally anything that can take one of the two possible values example are True False Yes No 0 1 on off 
Assignment operator is used to assign values to the variables.
Sequence of instructions
A program is a sequence of instructions given to a computer
A variable is created when u will assign value for the first time 
Expression is a combination of values variables and operations
BODMAS
Bracket Order
Input and Output Basics:
Input allows flexibility to take input from user
String Concatenation:
Joins strings together and possible only for strings
String Repetition: * operator is used for string ex: a="*"*10
length of string: len()
String Indexing: We can access individual character in string using their position which are called as index example like a[0]
