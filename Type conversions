String Slicing
Obtaining a part of string is called slicing.
Ex: a[startindex:endindex]
end index is not included
Exampleis a[3:7] here 7  is not included
Slicing to end if end index is not specified slicing stops at end of string
Ex:a[3:]
Slicing from start: If start index is not specified then slice starts from index 0
Ex:[:2]
if nothing specified it taked from start to end Ex:a[:]
To check data type then we have to write as type()
Type Convertion:
Coverting value of one data type to another data type is called as type casting
Ex: int to string float to int string to  int etc
int float str bool
