Block of code:
A sequence of instructions are called block of code
Conditional Statement:
It allows to execute block of code only when a specific condition is True.
if:
if condition:
  block of code
 Example:
 if condition:
    block of code
 else:
    block of code
IN above condition else will execute only when if condition is false
Example
a = int(input())
if a > 0:  
    print("Positive")  
else:  
    print("Not Positive")  
print("End")
input is 2
output is Positive  End
Modulus operator:
To find reminder we use modulus operator
EXponent to calculate power of b we use 
for square root we use (a)**0.5
Nested statements:
Nested Conditions
The conditional block inside another if/else conditional block is called as nested conditional block.
In the below example, Block 2 is nested conditional block and condition B is called nested conditional statement.
Ex: if conditionA:
        block1
        if conditionB:
              block2
              block3
    block4
EX:matches_won = int(input())
goals = int(input())
if matches_won > 8:
    if goals > 20:
        print("Hurray")
    print("Winner")
INput 10
22
output:Hurray
Winner
input:10
18
Output:Winner
Nested Condition in Else Block
We can also write nested conditions in Else Statement.

In the below example Block 2 is a nested conditional block.
if condition A:
    block1
else:
    if condition B:
        block2
        block3
block4
Example:
a = 2
b = 3
c = 1
is_a_greatest = (a > b) and (a > c)
if is_a_greatest:
    print(a)
else:
    is_b_greatest = (b > c)
    if is_b_greatest:
        print(b)
    else:
        print(c)
output:3
Elif Statement
Use the elif statement to have multiple conditional statements between if and else.

The elif statement is optional.
EX if condition A:
        block1
   elif condition B:
        block2
   else:
      block3
Example:
number = 5
is_divisible_by_10 = (number % 10 == 0)
is_divisible_by_5 = (number % 5 == 0)
if is_divisible_by_10:
    print("Divisible by 10")
elif is_divisible_by_5:
    print("Divisible by 5")
else:
   print("Not Divisible by 10 or 5")
Output:Divisible by 5
