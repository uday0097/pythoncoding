Nested Loops
An inner loop within the repeating block of an outer loop is called Nested Loop.

The Inner Loop will be executed one time for each iteration of the Outer Loop.
Ex: for item in A:
        code1
        for item in B:
            code2
        code3
    code4
Progran:
for i in range(2):
  print("Outer: " + str(i))
  for j in range(2):
    print(" Inner: " + str(j))
o/p:
Outer: 0
 Inner: 0
 Inner: 1
Outer: 1
 Inner: 0
 Inner: 1
 Nested Repeating Block
The one highlighted in the blue dotted line is the repeating block of the inner loop.
Program:
for i in range(2):
  print("Outer: " + str(i))
  for j in range(2):
    print(" Inner: " + str(j))
print("END")
o/p:Outer: 0
 Inner: 0
 Inner: 1
Outer: 1
 Inner: 0
 Inner: 1
END
