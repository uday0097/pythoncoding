Comparing Strings
Computer internally stores characters as numbers.

Every character has a unique Unicode value.

Ord
To find the Unicode value of a character, we use the ord()

ord(character) gives unicode value of the character.
Ex:
unicode_value = ord("A")
print(unicode_value)
o/p:
65
chr
To find the character with the given Unicode value, we use the chr()

chr(unicode) gives character with the unicode value.  
char = chr(75)
print(char)
o/p: K
Unicode Ranges
48 - 57 -> Number Digits (0 - 9)

65 - 90 -> Capital Letters (A - Z)

97 - 122 -> Small Letters (a - z)

Rest -> Special Characters, Other Languages

Printing Characters
The below code will print the characters from A to Z
ex:
for unicode_value in range(65,91):
    print(chr(unicode_value))
Comparing Strings
In Python, strings are compared considering unicode.
Ex:print("A" < "B") T
As unicode value of A is 65 and B is 66, which internally compares 65 < 66 . So the output should be True

Character by Character Comparison
In Python, String Comparison is done character by character.

print("BAD" >= "BAT")   F
print("98" < "984")     T
Naming Variables Rule #1
Use only the below characters  

Capital Letters ( A – Z )
Small Letters ( a – z )
Digits ( 0 – 9 )
Underscore(_)

Examples:
age, total_bill
Naming Variables Rule #2
Below characters cannot be used  

Blanks ( )
Commas ( , )
Special Characters
( ~ ! @ # $ % ^ . ?, etc. )
Naming Variables Rule #3
Variable name must begin with  

Capital Letters ( A – Z )
Small Letters ( a – z )
Underscore( _ )
Naming Variables Rule #4
Cannot use Keywords, which are reserved for special meaning  

int
str
print etc.,
Keywords
Words which are reserved for special meaning  
help("keywords")
Case Styles
Camel case: totalBill
Pascal case: TotalBill
Snake case: total_bill
Snake case is preferred for naming the variables in Python.
Round
Rounding Numbers
round(number, digits(optional))  Rounds the float value to the given number of decimal digits.

digits -> define the number of decimal digits to be considered for rounding.

when not specified default is 0
a = round(3.14,1)
print(a)
a = round(3.14)
print(a)
o/p 3.1 3
Floating Point Approximation
Float values are stored approximately.
print(0.1 + 0.2) 0.3000000000004
Floating Point Errors
Sometimes, floating point approximation gives unexpected results.
print((0.1 + 0.2) == 0.3) F
Comments
Comment starts with a hash #  

It can be written in  its own line next to a statement of code.
