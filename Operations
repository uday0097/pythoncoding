Relational Operators are used to compare values 
Ex: > < == <= >= !=
ex: 12==12.0 output is true
True=="True" false
Logical operations are used to perform logical operation on boolean values
And if both conditions are true then only it is true else false
Or ir any onw condition is true then true else false
Not will gives opposite value
